# todo-app-v2
 * improvements over the original todo-app I made with Vanilla JS. 


## TO-DO 
  * fix weird CSS concatenation bug 
  * fix issue where user can only tick the first todo and not the ones below it (issue with tick function) 
  * bring in bootstrap ✅
  * rename classes / IDs for JS section ✅
  * add event listener for X to get rid of an individual todo 
  * add eventlistener for clear all todos button ✅
  * add checkbox with tick (via bootstrap) ✅
  * fix deleteOrTick() function ✅
  * fix deleteTask() function ✅
  * cleanup console errors ✅
  * clean up and refactor JS ✅
  
## extra 
  * add the user's TODO list to local storage so that when they refresh the browser the todo items will persist and not be cleared out.
